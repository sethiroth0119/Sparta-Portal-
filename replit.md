- July 30, 2025. CRITICAL DATA MIXING FIX COMPLETED: Resolved major data cross-contamination issue where companies were getting content from other companies' datatable rows (e.g., McGuire Development Company receiving CBRE Buffalo content) - implemented company-specific content verification that ensures each company only receives content that explicitly mentions their company name or related terms, preventing all data mixing; auto-populate now correctly extracts company-specific content with exact matching validation, confirmed working with "Quick thought about McGuire Development Company" extracting proper company-specific copywrite instead of mixed data
- July 30, 2025. AUTO-POPULATE EXTRACTION LOGIC COMPLETELY REWRITTEN: Fixed fundamental issue where auto-populate was generating template content instead of extracting real data from user airtables - completely replaced pattern-matching logic with direct column name mapping to extract actual work from user's "Final subject", "Final Copywrite", "Base Subject", "Base Copywrite", and "Dm" columns; system now pulls real content like "Quick thought about McGuire Development Company" and "Hey [Business Owner's Name], I was thinking about McGuire Development Company..." instead of generating templates, preserving all user's manual work and effort in airtables
- July 30, 2025. CRITICAL SYNTAX ERROR RESOLUTION: Fixed major syntax errors in autoPopulateSendOuts method that were preventing system startup due to malformed try-catch structure and missing closing braces - completely rebuilt method with proper bracket structure, enhanced flexible company name matching (handles punctuation variations, partial matches, multi-word matching), exact column ID mapping for Blockchain table structure, fallback mapping for other table structures, comprehensive error handling, and verified system startup and functionality; auto-populate system now fully operational with enhanced data extraction capabilities from all users' datatables

- July 30, 2025. SEND OUT UPDATE SYSTEM CLARIFICATION: Clarified and fixed the auto-populate system to properly UPDATE existing Send Out records with datatable column data - system now matches exact column names ("Final Subject Line", "LinkedIn DM", "Final Copywrite") to form fields and updates Send Out records with the actual content from those columns; removed confusing "auto-populate" terminology and made it clear this UPDATES existing records with datatable data, not creates new data
